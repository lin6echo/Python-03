# for loops = execute a block of code a fixed number of times.
#             You can iterate over a range, string, sequence, etc.

for x in range(1, 11): # counter = x, etc
    print(x)

for x in reversed(range(1, 11)): # counter = x, etc
    print(x)
print("HAPPY NEW YEAR!")

for x in range(1, 11, 2): # counter = x, etc
    print(x)
